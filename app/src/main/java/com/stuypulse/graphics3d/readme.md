# Graphics 3d

## TODO

* Consider changing `GlObject` to a class that automatically adds an instance to the `Window.MANAGER`
* Replace lighting with better algorithm
* Instead of putting all the vertices in gpu memory, replace it with a vertex pool and triangles made up of indices
* Add floor, skybox, smoother camera movement?
* Add description of project
