# Graphics 3d

## TODO

* Add unidirectional light source (easy to calculate, especially in fragment shader)
* Add color to triangles (or to each vertex) and a normal to a surface (add attribute pointers)
* Instead of putting all the vertices in gpu memory, replace it with a vertex pool and triangles made up of indices
* Add object file support
* Add floor, skybox, smoother camera movement?
* Add description of project
